                <p>Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-1881) was a Russian author and philosopher who is 
                    considered one of the greatest literary figures of all time. He is best known
                     for his works of fiction such as "Crime and Punishment," "The Brothers Karamazov," 
                     and "Notes from Underground." His writing style was characterized by psychological
                      introspection and exploration of moral and philosophical questions. Dostoevsky is
                       recognized for his contributions to the development of existentialist and absurdist
                        literature.</p>
                        <p>Fyodor is the leader of an underground organization called the Rats in the House 
                            of the Dead, and is the founder and former member of the Decay of the Angel. Because of his very high level of intellect,
                              Fyodor is one of the most difficult opponents the Armed Detective Agency has ever faced.
                               He serves as both the acquaintance and archenemy of Osamu Dazai. He is based off of
                                the Russian author with the same name.</p>
